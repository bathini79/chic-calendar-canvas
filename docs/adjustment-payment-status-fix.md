# Adjustment Payment Status Fix

This feature implements a fix for an issue where adjustments in the payroll system were being automatically marked as paid due to a database trigger.

## Problem

The `fix_payment_status_after_populate` database trigger was automatically marking adjustments as paid immediately after they were inserted into the `pay_run_items` table, regardless of the pay run's status.

## Solution

1. Created a new database function `add_adjustment_to_pay_run` that:
   - Temporarily disables the `fix_payment_status_after_populate` trigger
   - Inserts the adjustment with `is_paid = FALSE`
   - Re-enables the trigger

2. Modified the `addAdjustment` function in `payRunService.ts` to use this new database function instead of directly inserting into the table.

3. Added a migration script to fix any existing adjustments that were incorrectly marked as paid.

## Implementation Details

The solution follows the same pattern used for commission recalculation, which faced a similar issue. By temporarily disabling the trigger, we can insert adjustments with the correct payment status without interference.

- `supabase/migrations/20250610000003_fix_existing_adjustments.sql` (new)
- `src/services/payRunService.ts`

## How to Test

1. Create a new pay run or use an existing one that is not marked as paid
2. Add an adjustment using the adjustment modal
3. Verify that the adjustment is not automatically marked as paid
4. Process the payment normally through the UI to confirm the adjustment can be paid correctly
